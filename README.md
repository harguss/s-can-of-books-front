**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Estimates
<!-- See below -->

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->

## Team Agreement

### Logistical  

1. What hours will you be available to communicate?  
    Any, will respond when available  

2. What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?  
    Slack

3. How often will you take breaks?
    Every hour or as needed

4. What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
    Ask for help from Jack and Craig

### Cooperative  

1. Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
    Susan- Artistic, makes beautiful pages, a lot of preserverance
    Leah- Ask a lot of questions, a basic understanding of the project, always come to class

2. How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
    We plan to attend every class, ask questions, and make a beautiful can of books

3. In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
    Leah- a better understanding of the code
    Susan- a better understanding of functions and how to use database

4. Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?  
    We will review our work with each other everyday and explain and how it works  

### Conflict Resolution  

1. What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?  
    We will be alternating branches each time so there will be an aspect of built-in accountability. If one person is not we will have a meeting with Craig to discuss concerns.

2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
    We will be alternating branches each time so there will be an aspect of built-in accountability and delegating tasks. If one person is not collaborating we will have a meeting with Craig to discuss concerns.

3. How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?  
    We'll work through it together and help each other, especially when we are reviewing and explaining our code.
